An intelligent AI-powered healthcare scheduling system that automates patient booking, reduces no-shows, and streamlines clinic operations. This project addresses real-world healthcare challenges by implementing a complete patient appointment workflow with AI-driven patient lookup, smart scheduling, automated reminders, multi-channel communication, and administrative reporting.

**Project Context**: This is a case study implementation for a Data Science Internship position, demonstrating practical AI solutions for healthcare technology challenges.

## 🎯 Business Problem & Objectives

Medical practices lose 20-50% revenue due to no-shows, missed insurance collection, and scheduling inefficiencies. This AI agent solves these operational pain points by:

- **Automating Patient Booking**: Intelligent lookup and classification system
- **Reducing No-Shows**: Multi-stage reminder system with confirmation tracking
- **Streamlining Operations**: Automated form distribution and administrative reporting
- **Improving Efficiency**: Smart scheduling with preference-based filtering

**Key Metrics Addressed**:
- Reduce no-show rates through proactive reminders
- Automate insurance collection and verification
- Minimize administrative overhead with automated reporting
- Enhance patient experience with conversational booking

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Multi-Agent System Design

The AI Scheduling Agent implements a sophisticated **LangGraph-based multi-agent orchestration system** that coordinates specialized agents to handle different aspects of the appointment scheduling workflow. This architecture provides intelligent routing, error handling, and state management across the entire patient journey.

### Agent Design & Workflow

### State Management & Routing

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PatientProcessing
    PatientProcessing --> SchedulerProcessing: Patient Data Valid
    PatientProcessing --> ErrorHandling: Validation Failed

    ConfirmationProcessing --> CommunicationProcessing: Booking Successful
    ConfirmationProcessing --> ErrorHandling: Booking Failed
    CommunicationProcessing --> [*]: Workflow Complete
    ErrorHandling --> [*]: Error Handled
```

### Dual Workflow Architecture

The system supports **two operational modes** for maximum flexibility:

#### 1. **LangGraph Multi-Agent Mode** (Primary)
