# Image to Oil Paint Style Converter

![Oil Paint Style Converter](public/placeholder.svg)

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Kedhareswer/Image-to-Oil_Paint)](LICENSE)

Transform your ordinary photos into beautiful oil paint style artwork with enhanced texture and depth. This web application uses advanced computer vision techniques to create realistic oil painting effects.

---

## Features

- **Easy Image Upload**: Drag & drop or browse to upload your images
- **Camera Integration**: Take photos directly with your device camera
- **Customizable Effects**: Adjust intensity, brush size, and color vibrance
- **Real-time Conversion**: Transform your photos with a single click
- **Download Options**: Save your oil paint masterpieces to your device
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python with OpenCV for image processing
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI component library
- **Image Processing**: Advanced computer vision techniques for oil paint effects

---

## How It Works

The application uses a sophisticated image processing pipeline to transform photos:

1. **Image Analysis**: Your image is analyzed to identify edges, textures, and color patterns
2. **Brush Stroke Simulation**: Multiple layers of simulated brush strokes are applied
3. **Color Blending & Texture**: Advanced color quantization and canvas texture create the rich look of oil paintings

---

## Technical Details

The conversion engine uses several techniques to achieve an authentic oil paint effect:

- Multi-layer brush simulation with varying sizes and directions
- Canvas texture integration to mimic real painting surfaces
- Adaptive color quantization for the distinctive oil paint look
- Edge-aware stylization to preserve important details
- Dynamic brush pressure simulation for realistic results
